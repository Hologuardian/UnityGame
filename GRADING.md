# UnityMech
Mech game for my Unity class

I think I deserve a grade of 98% on this game.

Mostly in part because of the effort and the final outcome of the game itself. 
I decided that I wanted to make a pretty game since unity lets me skip the coding aspect of the game, letting me focus on shaders and AI.
While not demonstrated fully the AI spheres will hover above the player in random spheres while shooting them, this is more easily tested outside the maze.
I used the basic tools we were supposed to make in the class for "assignments" and blended them together to make an interesting proof of concept for a game that I will be building on for the next few weeks.
