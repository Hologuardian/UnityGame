I'm planning on making a first person mech game. The player will control a large robot capable of large amounts of destruction.
The UI will be as simple as possible, with targeting being a simple hover and will abstract icons representing ammunition and hull integrity.
Destructible objects as well as large terrain maps with AI enemies for the player to destroy.
Weapon customization and loadouts for mechs.
